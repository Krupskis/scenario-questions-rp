# scenario-questions-rp
This codebase is part of the research project that I did as part of my Bachelor's of Computer Science at TU Delft. Our peer group worked on designing user interfaces to elicit personal values.
I particularly tried to answer "How does a graphical user interface that uses in comparison questioning influence the accuracy of user value model?"

## How to run?
1. Install jupyter notebook
2. Run `jupyter notebook`
3. Locate the scenario you want to create a tree for
4. Populate the answers. There are two arrays for each scenario: `base` and `context`. `base` should be filled with answers to the first set of questions, while `context` will be filled with answers to the second set of questions.
5. Run and you will see a generated tree.
